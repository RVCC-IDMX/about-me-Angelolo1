            <h3>Lorum Ipsum</h3>

            <p>"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To determine
                its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices
                of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which
                at the time of the wife's death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now,
                through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each
                daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is
                evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would
                have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a
                very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has
                proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of
                anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling,
                especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in
                his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.
                I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
                pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can
                twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all
                that we need."</p>

            <p>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we
                hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the
                lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few
                fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing
                out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of
                the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet
                promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My
                companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down
                over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.
                Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the
                meadows.</p>

            <p>"Look there!" said he.</p>

            <p>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove
                at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables
                and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</p>

            <p>"Stoke Moran?" said he.</p>

            <p>"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked the driver.</p>
